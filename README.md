# ComponentLab

**The AI-first playground for frontend components.**  
_Currently in development — core editor and preview functionality is live._

ComponentLab is a real-time UI code lab where developers design and iterate on individual frontend components. It’s fast, focused, and built for creativity — even before the AI kicks in.
